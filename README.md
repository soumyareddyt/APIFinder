Coding exercise
The goal of this exercise is to build a simple Android app to search for GitHub repositories. 
A typical use case is:
1.	User opens the app.
2.	Types the search query. E.g. “Game of Life” or “JSON parser”.
3.	Taps the “Search” button to search for GitHub repositories.
4.	Search results displayed below sorted by the stars number in descending order.
User Interface
Keep the UI simple and functional. Fancy and super polished UI is not the goal here as the time is limited. A simple query input, a “Search” button and a vertical scrollable list with search results will be enough. 

Let each row of the list to display an owner avatar, a repository name, description and the number of stars. For simplicity, you can just use a Unicode symbol ★ instead of the star icon.
Data
Please use the GitHub API to search for repositories. The API is free, public and doesn’t require an account or authorization, so the API is easy to test just from the browser.
